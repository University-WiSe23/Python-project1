# Python-projects:
These projects are from my first semester at uni[^1] (for medical data science) üë®‚Äçüî¨
They are solely my first tries at Python and coding.
The files are .ipynb - notebooks that consist of 1 or more exercises (written in markdown) and my solutions

| Project# | Description what topics were covered                                                     |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0        | The very first try at Python, getting to know functions, data types and escape-sequences |
| 1        | String functions, data types                                                             |
| 2        | Calculations and print() function                                                        |
| 3        | First look at lists                                                                      |
| 4        | Methods and calculations                                                                 |
| 5        | Blood pressure calculations (first topic related coding)                                 |
| 6        | Defining new, custom functions                                                           |
| 7        | Using packages (Matplotlib), graphics, visualisation                                     |
| 8        | Control structures (if-then-else)                                                        |
| 9        | While loops and Python version of for each (for x in)                                    |
| 10       | More dimensional lists                                                                   |

(Technically we also discussed dictionaries and used them, project might follow up, if not here - then within the second semester projects)
